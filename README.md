# N-Queens (8Queens) Solver

## Description

This project is aimed at solving the N-Queens problem using both an iterative and recursive solution. Both methods employ a backtracking algorithm to allow the program to solve higher degree problems more effectively. Successful solutions are outputed along with the number of results and duration of the search.
